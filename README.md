# Web Scraping and SimHash Assignment

## Overview
This project contains two Python programs developed as part of an assignment.

1. **Web Scraper**
   - Fetches a webpage using a given URL
   - Prints the title of the page
   - Prints the body text
   - Prints all hyperlinks present on the page

2. **SimHash Similarity**

   - Compares both fingerprints
   - Outputs the number of common bits (similarity measure)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- urllib


## Output
